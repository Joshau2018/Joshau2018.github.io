        This quote was proven to be so true in my golfing expedition. It was the
        weekend me and a couple of friends decided that we should go to topgolf
        the following week. One thing led to another and we had a group of 5. We
        then scheduled to meet up at TopGolf on July 18, 2023, a Tuesday, at
        10:30 a.m. We decided on Tuesday, because every Tuesday the time at
        TopGolf is half-priced. I say, “time,” since TopGolf charges based on
        the amount of time spent playing there, and not by per person. Soon, I
        would be embarking on an expedition to TopGolf, not knowing how much it
        would affect my life.

        But first, what is top golf? TopGolf started when two brothers, Steve
        Joliffe and Dave Joliffe, decided that standard driving ranges are
        boring, and decided to create a more engaging and trackable way to
        practice. Thus, they made a high tech game that had sensors that tracked
        where the distance and direction they went. Eventually, leading to the
        idea of adding targets to aim at. This was their very first actual game
        mode called TopGolf. This led to various other game modes such as: Angry
        Birds, TopScore, and Quick 9. These game modes would eventually be worth
        billions. TopGolf is an amazing place that offers its players of diverse
        experience levels a way to enjoy golf and to work on their skills.

        The day has arrived, it is now July 18, 2023, the time in central time
        is nine a.m. The weather is slightly cloudy with the temperature being
        in the high 80’s. Zakk, the mastermind in producing the idea of going to
        TopGolf, called me. He told me that his sister is going to come pick me
        up in fifteen minutes. When they finally arrived at my house Zakk got
        out to greet me. Zakk had a fresh new hair cut than the last time I saw
        him. He was wearing black prescription glasses. He had on a black button
        up shirt with black slacks and Jordan 11’s. Zakk’s height is about 6
        foot 3 inches. We spoke for a couple of seconds until I got in the car.
        I saw Brendon sitting in the back seat eating Hostess Chocolate Donuts.
        He offered to share. I rejected his offer, however. Brendon was wearing
        a T-shirt with blue jeans and crocs. Brendon is also tall, 6 foot 2
        inches. We then left to go to TopGolf.

        After the eventful car ride of Brendon eating donuts, Zakk and his
        sister dissing each other, and me listening to music we finally made it
        to TopGolf. We arrived at 9:50 a.m. we went inside where it looked nice
        and clean. There was a gift shop right where you go inside with button
        up shirts with the TopGolf logo on them each cost about sixty dollars.
        The hats were also expensive. Then there was a bar to the left of us.
        Zakk then walked up to the cashier in the gift shop and asked to buy
        game time. They told him that there was a 50-minute wait, so we waited
        in the bar and got some drinks that were non-alcoholic obviously and we
        passed the time watching TikTok and talking among each other.
        Eventually, Kayden showed up, sat down, and ordered a drink. Kayden was
        wearing a white button up shirt with khakis and dress shoes with
        glasses. Me and Kayden were the only Latinos within the group with Zakk
        and Brendon both being Anglo-American. We started to talk until we
        finally got a lobby to play in.

        Once we got to the lobby to play, I saw the view from a balcony onto a
        field with golf balls scattered around and colored circular targets with
        different rings at various distances, with white being the farthest we
        could see. All of this was surrounded by a giant black net. After a
        couple of seconds of taking in the view Zakk imposed a question, “What
        game mode would y’all want to play.” We ended up deciding on TopScore, a
        game mode where the further the target is the more points awarded. We
        each got 20 shots total, so we each did 5 shots at a time.

        The first one up was Zakk he chose to use the driver out of a club
        container provided. Zakk walks over the tape on the floor warning to
        stand back when someone is swinging and on to the turf with a tee on the
        left and right. Zakk scanned the golf club on the ball dispenser that
        was on the right side and a ball shot out a tube and rolled to him. He
        placed the ball on the right tee, took a couple steps back, aligned the
        club with the ball, and swung. The ball made a loud crack sound and it
        curved hard to the right and hit the net. Zakk then got another ball,
        set it up, aligned himself then swung. This time the ball went straight
        into white Zakk earned 24 points. Zakk then made three more attempts,
        scoring an added 16 points bringing his total to 40 points. After Zakk’s
        turn it was my turn. I picked the same club that Zakk chose, a driver, I
        placed the ball on the tee lined up my shot then I swung. I completely
        missed the ball the first time. The second time I hit the ball; however,
        I barely tipped the ball causing it to travel for a brief moment before
        it hit the ground. Third time the charm, right? Nope, I did hit the
        ball, and it did travel a good distance, but the ball curved too far
        right hitting the net. This is when Brendon started to laugh. This is
        where I decided to switch clubs since the other one was oversized for my
        height. This time I was using the women's golf club that was provided. I
        walked up, set the ball up, positioned myself then I swung. The ball
        could easily be seen going straight into the second ring of the green
        target putting 8 points on the board for me. With the last one I tried
        to replicate the same hit just with more power. This is more difficult
        than hitting the ball, normally considering it went ten yards before
        landing. This was where Zakk told me, “If you relax you will actually be
        able to hit the ball further than if you are trying to force it.” After
        my turn it was Kayden’s turn, he did pretty well and got 24 points.
        Finally, it was Brendon's turn. It was pretty funny he missed the ball
        five times back-to-back on his first ball. Me and Kayden were making fun
        of him and laughing at him. Although that would be short lived because
        when Brendon finally made contact with the ball it went straight in the
        middle of brown giving him 36 points. Although after this hit he would
        go pointless for a while. Then, it was Zakk’s turn he kind of choked by
        managing to miss every target either by barely bouncing over it or going
        straight into the net. Now it was my turn with Zakk's wisdom in mind. I
        relaxed and focused on hitting the ball. I didn’t aim at a particular
        target, I was just zoned in on hitting the ball and somehow, I managed
        to hit it in the blue target’s second ring thanks to a lucky bounce,
        giving me a total of 24 points. My next four hits however would avoid
        the target. Kayden’s turn would go slightly worse than before, only
        bringing his score up to 30 points. Brandon's first hit was probably a
        fluke, because he managed not to get a single point. We did not laugh
        though because of karma. Zakk’s next five would be amazing, making four
        out of five in a target. By the end of this turn he would have a total
        of 78 points. Next it would be my turn to make only two of these shots
        giving me a total of 40. Kayden’s turn arrived. He made one shot
        bringing his total to 42 points. Brandon only made one shot making his
        total 36. Only Zakk would make a shot on the last turn bringing him to a
        total that I rather not say. We would play several more games of various
        game modes such as an Angry Birds game mode where Brandon would win,
        because he set his difficulty too easy when the rest of us were on hard
        mode.

        As we played more games, I gradually became more relaxed and comfortable
        with golfing. As a result, my performance improved, which in turn caused
        me to find myself experiencing more joy with friends. This lesson at
        TopGolf can also be applied to other scenarios; it applies to scenarios
        such as taking an exam, where the more relaxed I am the more information
        I can remember, or when I am playing a video game, where with a calm
        state of mind my performance is at its best.

        Through this experience, my ideology has undergone a transition. I
        shifted from believing that I should be serious all the time to
        believing that a relaxed state of mind is instrumental to enjoy life to
        the fullest. I also learned a valuable lesson: I should never challenge
        Zakk to a competitive game of TopGolf, because he will undoubtedly win.
        The grand expedition to TopGolf has shifted to more of a leisurely
        excursion at TopGolf.
